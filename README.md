<p>This is the final project for CIS 658 - Web Architectures at GVSU.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>The web app must utilize a database backend.</li>
<li>Utilize a responsive CSS framework of your choice (Bootstrap, Pure, etc.) so that your web app
looks great on mobile devices as well as desktops.</li>
<li>Make sure you have at least one UI feature that uses AJAX.</li>
<li>Expose the key data persisted in your apps database via a RESTful web service. The web service
should be documented somewhere obvious in your web app (e.g. a link “developers” on your page footer, or about page).</li>
<li>Make sure all forms, fields, etc. are implemented. Your web app should be completely
implemented at the conclusion of this project.</li>
<li>Deployment: You must deploy your app on a cloud-based hosting provider (you can deploy free on
Heroku as demonstrated in class).</li>
</ul>
